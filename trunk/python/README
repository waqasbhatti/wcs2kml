To install, run 'python setup.py install' or copy the modules (everything
not in the scripts subdirectory, including the fits directory) to any directory
listed in your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Imagery related scripts:

fits2png.py -- Creates PNG image from a FITS file (see fitsimage.py for
               more control over the output).
ext2fits.py -- Creates a set of single extension FITS images from a
               multi-extension FITS image.
wcs2fits.py -- Creates a FITS header from an ascii file containing FITS-like
               keywords with a WCS.

Placemark related scripts:

fits2kml.py       -- Creates a series of placemarks from a FITS file with a
                     binary table.  Once placemark per row is created.
regionate_fits.py -- Similar to fits2kml.py, but generates regionated output.

Modules:

fitslib.py             -- FITS reading/writing library
wcslib.py              -- WCS library (only supports TAN and TAN-SIPS)
fitsimage.py           -- Module for treating FITS images as Python Imaging
                          Library objects.
pointarray.py          -- Least squares fitting library
line.py                -- Simple line class
fits.fitsparse.py      -- Converts FITS table data into a placemark data
                          structure
fits.fitsregionator.py -- Regionates placemarks (as output by fits.fitsparse)
